# Lesson 4: Deploy a Ratings application in the ARO cluster

In this workshop lesson, you will be deploying a ratings application in your ARO cluster.

|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| * A MongoDB with pre-loaded data                   | * [Data](https://github.com/microsoft/rating-api/raw/master/data.tar.gz)             |
| * A public facing API `rating-api`
   * A NodeJS application that connects to mongoDB container app to retrieve and rate items
   * The container exposes port 8080
   * MongoDB connection is configured using an environment variable called MONGODB_URI
   * Weâ€™ll build the container app using the [source-to-image (S2I) build strategy](https://aroworkshop.io/#source-to-image-s2i)         | [GitHub repo](https://github.com/microsoft/rating-web)             |

Here's what we'll be completing in this lesson:

> * Creating a [project](https://docs.openshift.com/aro/4/applications/projects/working-with-projects.html) on the Azure Red Hat OpenShift Web Console
> * Deploying a MongoDB container that uses Azure Disks for [persistent storage](https://docs.openshift.com/aro/4/storage/understanding-persistent-storage.html)
> * Deploying a Node JS API and frontend app from Git Hub using [Source-To-Image (S2I)](https://docs.openshift.com/aro/4/openshift_images/create-images.html)
> * Exposing the web application frontend using [Routes](https://docs.openshift.com/aro/4/networking/routes/route-configuration.html)
> * Creating a [network policy](https://docs.openshift.com/aro/4/networking/network_policy/about-network-policy.html) to control communication between the different tiers in the application

## Setup the prerequisites
### Prepare your Azure subscription
1. Before proceeding with the lesson, you need to have an Azure subscription with either the Owner role assignment OR the Contributor plus User Access Administrator role assignments

2. Azure Red Hat OpenShift requires a minimum of 40 cores to create and run an OpenShift cluster. The default Azure resource quota for a new Azure subscription does not meet this requirement. To request an increase in your resource limit, see [Standard quota: Increase limits by VM series](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-portal/supportability/per-vm-quota-requests?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5003870)

### Register the resource providers
To successfully deploy the ARO cluster, you need to register the **"Microsoft.RedHatOpenShift"** resource providers. We will also ensure that the **"Microsoft.Compute"** and **"Microsoft.Storage"** resource providers are also registered.

1. Go to [https://shell.azure.com](https://shell.azure.com) and sign in with your Azure credentials

2. If you have multiple Azure subscriptions, specify the relevant subscription ID:

    ```
    az account set --subscription <SUBSCRIPTION ID>
    ```

3. Register the three resource providers:

    ```
    az provider register -n Microsoft.RedHatOpenShift -n Microsoft.Compute -n Microsoft.Storage --wait
    ```
## Create the required virtual network and subnets
Azure Red Hat OpenShift clusters require a virtual network with two empty subnets, for the master and worker nodes. In this section, we will create a resource group and then create a virtual network (containing the two empty subnets) for the ARO cluster.
### Create a virtual network containing two empty subnets

1. **Set the following variables in the shell environment in which you will execute the `az` commands.**
> [!NOTE] 
   > Azure Red Hat OpenShift is not available in all regions where an Azure resource group can be created. See [Available regions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/global-infrastructure/services/?products=openshift&regions=all) for information on where Azure Red Hat OpenShift is supported. Make sure you enter a supported location as your variable below.

   ```
   LOCATION=uksouth       # Modify this to the location that you want your cluster in
   RESOURCEGROUP=aro-workshop-rg   # the name of the resource group where you want to create your cluster           
   CLUSTER=arocluster        # the name of your cluster
   ```

2. **Create a resource group.**

   ```
   az group create \
     --name $RESOURCEGROUP \
     --location $LOCATION
   ```

2. **Create a virtual network.**

   Create a new virtual network in the same resource group you created earlier:

   ```
   az network vnet create \
      --resource-group $RESOURCEGROUP \
      --name aro-vnet \
      --address-prefixes 10.0.0.0/22
   ```

3. **Add an empty subnet for the master nodes.**
The subnet is created with a service endpoint connection to Azure Container Registry (ACR)
   ```
   az network vnet subnet create \
     --resource-group $RESOURCEGROUP \
     --vnet-name aro-vnet \
     --name master-subnet \
     --address-prefixes 10.0.0.0/23 \
     --service-endpoints Microsoft.ContainerRegistry
   ```

4. **Add an empty subnet for the worker nodes.**

   ```
   az network vnet subnet create \
     --resource-group $RESOURCEGROUP \
     --vnet-name aro-vnet \
     --name worker-subnet \
     --address-prefixes 10.0.2.0/23 \
     --service-endpoints Microsoft.ContainerRegistry
   ```

5. **[Disable subnet private endpoint policies](../private-link/disable-private-link-service-network-policy.md) on the master subnet.** This is required for the service to be able to connect to and manage the cluster.

   ```
   az network vnet subnet update \
     --name master-subnet \
     --resource-group $RESOURCEGROUP \
     --vnet-name aro-vnet \
     --disable-private-link-service-network-policies true
   ```

## Create the ARO cluster

```
az aro create \
  --resource-group $RESOURCEGROUP \
  --name $CLUSTER \
  --vnet aro-vnet \
  --master-subnet master-subnet \
  --worker-subnet worker-subnet
```

After executing the `az aro create` command, it normally takes about 35 minutes to create a cluster.
